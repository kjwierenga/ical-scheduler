This scheduler written in ruby will allow you to execute arbitrary ruby code written
in the 'description' field of an ical calendar URL feed (such as those produced
by Google Calendar).

This project uses the following projects:
* rubyredrick-ri_cal to parse and evaluate ical files
* jmettraux-rufus-scheduler to schedule the (recurring) events and execute the ruby code
  from the calendar
